This is a Maven App which uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Every time code is deployed either via the App Studio or by commiting to this repo, the Maven App will be updated and available at your app url:

`https://<appId>.onmaven.app`

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/route.ts`.

To edit Maven App hooks modify `src/index.ts`.

## Learn More

To learn more about Maven, check out our [documentation](http://developers.mavenagi.com).

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
